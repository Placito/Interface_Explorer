# Interface Explorer

Interface Explorer is a desktop application developed using the **Rust** programming language and the **Tauri** framework. It leverages **React** for the frontend and is powered by **Vite** for a fast development experience.

---

## About the Project

This application provides detailed insights into your system's network interfaces and allows for managing IP addresses seamlessly.

---

## Features

### 1. **List of Network Interfaces**
Displays all network interfaces (active/inactive) on a system, with the following details:
- **Name**  
- **Type** (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)  
- **Status** (active/inactive)  
- **MAC Address** (Media Access Control)
- (optional) **Gateway** (is a device that acts as an access point between different networks) and **DNS** (Domain Name System)

### 2. **Interface Selection**
Enables users to select a specific network interface for detailed management.

### 3. **IP Address Listing**
Lists all IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) configured on the selected network interface.

### 4. **IPv4 Address Management**
The list of network interfaces is stored in a JSON file, allowing you to add, update, and delete entries.
For small or simple applications, this approach works perfectly fine and doesn't require the overhead of setting up a database:
- **Create IPv4 addresses**  
- **Delete IPv4 addresses**  
- **Modify existing IPv4 addresses**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Rust**  
- **Bun** ([Installation Guide](https://bun.sh/))  
- **Node.js** (optional, for additional development tooling)

---

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Interface_Explorer.git
   cd Interface_Explorer
3. Install Dependencies using Bun:
   ``bun install``
4. Start development server:
   ``bun run tauri dev``

### Setup & Build Instructions for GitHub Codespaces 
(Tauri is a cross-platform framework, meaning it supports building applications for various operating systems. However, if you're using GitHub Codespaces, there are certain limitations. While you can view and interact with the project in the browser, the list of interfaces might not be visible, as Codespaces doesn't fully replicate the local environment required to view them. To see the interfaces locally, you may need to run the project on your local machine.)

1. Install Bun
Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime and package manager. Install it by running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc  # Reload shell configuration´
````

2. Install Rust & Cargo
Rust is required for building the Tauri application. Install Rust and Cargo (Rust’s package manager) using:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.bashrc  # Reload shell configuration
```

3. Install System Dependencies (Linux)
If you're using GitHub Codespaces or a Linux system, install GTK dependencies for Tauri:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libgtk-3-dev pkg-config
```


### Building the Project


1. Install Dependencies using Bun:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
2. Build the project: (running cargo build without changing to the same directory of Cargo.toml file)

   2.1. Just compile Rust backend
   ```bash
   cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
   ```

   2.2. When you are ready to release the full app
   ```bash
   cargo tauri build --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   bun run tauri dev
   ```
